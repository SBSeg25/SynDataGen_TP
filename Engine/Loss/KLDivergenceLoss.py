    Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss (KL Divergence).

    This loss function computes the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)
    between the true distribution `y_true` and the predicted distribution `y_predicted`.
    The KL Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second,
    expected probability distribution.

    The formula for KL Divergence is as follows:

    Math:

        D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}

    Where:
        - P(i) is the true probability distribution (`y_true`).
        - Q(i) is the predicted probability distribution (`y_pred`).

    This loss function is often used in machine learning models that deal with probabilistic predictions,
    such as in variational autoencoders, generative models, and other tasks involving probability distributions.
