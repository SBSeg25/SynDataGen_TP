class DirectoryManager:
    """
    A class responsible for managing directory structures for various purposes,
    such as storing models, logs, generated data, evaluation results, and monitoring files.

    This class provides methods for:
    - Creating a base directory and subdirectories.
    - Retrieving paths of specific subdirectories (Logs, Monitor, ModelsSaved, DataGenerated, EvaluationResults).
    - Compressing the current directory into a ZIP file and cleaning up the original directory.

    Attributes:
        @base_directory (str): The base directory where all subdirectories will be stored (default is "Results").
        @current_subdir (str): The path to the current subdirectory, which is timestamped when created.

    Methods:
        @__init__(): Initializes the DirectoryManager, setting the base directory and preparing the subdirectory.
        @_create_directories(base_directory=None): Creates the base directory and necessary subdirectories.
        @get_logs_path(): Returns the path of the Logs subdirectory.
        @get_monitor_path(): Returns the path of the Monitor subdirectory.
        @get_models_saved_path(): Returns the path of the ModelsSaved subdirectory.
        @get_data_generated_path(): Returns the path of the DataGenerated subdirectory.
        @get_evaluation_results_path(): Returns the path of the EvaluationResults subdirectory.
        @zip_and_cleanup(): Compresses the current directory into a ZIP file and removes the original directory.

    Example:
        >>>     dir_manager = DirectoryManager()
        ...     dir_manager._create_directories()
        ...     logs_path = dir_manager.get_logs_path()
        >>>     dir_manager.zip_and_cleanup()

        when directories are created.

        Attributes:
            @base_directory (str): Default base directory "Results".
            @current_subdir (str): Placeholder for the current subdirectory path.
