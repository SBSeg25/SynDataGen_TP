    Softplus Activation Function Layer.

    The Softplus function is defined as:

        softplus(x) = log(exp(x) + 1)

    This is a smooth approximation to the ReLU activation function.
    It helps avoid dead neurons by providing a non-zero gradient even for negative values.

    Attributes
    ----------
    None

    Methods
    -------
    call(neural_network_flow: tensorflow.Tensor) -> tf.Tensor
        Applies the Softplus activation function to the input tensor and returns the output tensor.

    Example
    -------
    >>> import tensorflow
    ...    # Example tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, 8) â€” divisible by 2
    ...    input_tensor = tensorflow.random.uniform((2, 5, 8))
    ...    # Instantiate and apply SoftPlus
    ...    softplus_layer = SoftPlus()
    ...    output_tensor = softplus_layer(input_tensor)
    ...    # Output shape (batch_size, sequence_length, 4)
    ...    print(output_tensor.shape)
    >>>

        Returns
        -------
