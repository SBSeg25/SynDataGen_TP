    Copy is a naive machine learning model designed to generate synthetic data samples
    for specific classes based on provided real samples. This simple approach is primarily used
    for testing and comparison purposes, serving as a baseline method in experiments.

    This class extends the `Model` class from TensorFlow's Keras API, allowing integration into deep learning pipelines.

    Example:
        >>> python3
        ...     import numpy
        ...
        ...     # Define real samples and labels
        ...     x_real_samples = numpy.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
        ...     y_real_samples = numpy.array([0, 1, 0, 1])
        ...
        ...     # Define the number of samples per class
        ...     number_samples_per_class = {
        ...     "classes": {0: 2, 1: 2},

        Generates synthetic data samples for specified classes using real sample distributions.

        This naive approach selects samples from the provided dataset to create synthetic examples,

        any complex transformations or modifications to the data, making it a simple method for testing
