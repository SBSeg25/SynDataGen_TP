    A class for calculating Hamming Distance and Mean Hamming Distance between two binary distributions.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        get_metric(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the Mean Hamming Distance between two binary distributions.

    Exceptions:

        first_distribution = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1])
