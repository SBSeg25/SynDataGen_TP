    A class for calculating Jaccard Distance and Mean Jaccard Distance between two binary distributions.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        get_metric(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the Mean Jaccard Distance between two binary distributions.

    Exceptions:

        jaccard_distance = JaccardDistance()

        # Define two binary distributions as numpy arrays
        first_distribution = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1])
