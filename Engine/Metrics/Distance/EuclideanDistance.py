    A class for calculating Euclidean Distance and Mean Euclidean Distance between two distributions.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        get_mean_euclidean_distance(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the Mean Euclidean Distance between two distributions.

        get_euclidean_distance(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the Euclidean Distance between two distributions.

        _check_input_labels(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Check the validity and type of input distributions.

    Exceptions:
        EuclideanDistanceError: Custom exception class for handling Euclidean Distance calculation errors.

    Example:
        # Create an instance of the EuclideanDistance class
        euclidean_distance = EuclideanDistance()

        # Define two distributions as numpy arrays
        first_distribution = np.array([1, 2, 3])
